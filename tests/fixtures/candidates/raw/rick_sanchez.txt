PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Director, Global Program (AI Expert); TKS, Remote, 2024 – 2025
Ran global virtual program for 120 students from across the world. Worked with both the global team and students on learning initiatives,
sessions, and coaching. Designed AI-based curriculum and focused on AI in business for students and staff.
 Managed 120 different project portfolios from students and coached students to successful start-ups, internships, and large-scale team projects, largely focusing on AI projects
 Acted as AI specialist for projects in those fields, across the organization and designed AI and space-tech
sessions and projects
 Ran weekly sessions on both technologies, like AI and energy storage, and skill coaching, like presentations and team-based initiatives
 Engaged in dozens of weekly 1-on-1 and team meetings to coach students and staff in various areas
Associate VP, Senior AI Engineer; Chubb Insurance, Toronto ON, 2023 – 2024
Designed and built generative AI systems and a custom in-house LLM to enhance internal processes and create smart insurance system
using OpenAI's frameworks and APIs and Azure as well as open source LLMs.
 Created natural language understanding framework for processing unstructured insurance claim's notes
data and parse them into easily accessible knowledge for entire company and in-house knowledge graph
 Built custom PDF parser for unstructured PDF documents (this includes scanned documents, documents with tables, etc.) to create training data for in-house LLM
 Led PDF parsing project with multiple remote teams throughout the enterprise
 Worked in enterprise R&D team to develop AI technology for global operations
Technical Lead, Data Science; theScore, Toronto ON, 2021 – 2023
Hired to build and lead a team of data scientists by designing the project roadmap, building out processes for hiring & onboarding and
delivering high quality projects, including, but not limited to, work on user segmentation and a core NLP CS framework.
 Led the hiring initiatives, onboarding processes, career journeys, and overall best practices, and grew the
team from one to 13 members
 Developed 3-year data science project roadmap with nearly 40 projects
 Developed the Data Science tech stack alongside DE and MLOps
 Developed core user segmentation, clustering, and churn models for costumer profiles
 Built transformer NLP solution for the customer service team on chatlogs between users and agents
Lead Data Scientist (OT2 Search); OpenText, Remote, 2020 – 2021
Designed and deployed entire data science pipeline for next-generation intelligent-search, utilising both machine and deep learning for
search relevance. As the backbone of OpenText's new content delivery search platform, this must understand natural language queries
and the content and context of any arbitrary documents, as well as process user and enterprise data profiles.
 Led OT2 Search data science team to develop technology stack for company-wide AI framework
 Designed, alongside search team and management, AI-driven search pipeline to process data both offline
and at query time
 Developed transformer-based NLP frameworks for contextual understanding of documents and queries
 Developed AI ranking to rerank search results from queries, company info, and document content
Data Scientist (Anti-Money Laundering); Scotiabank, Toronto ON, 2019 – 2020
Built a network graph using bad actors as nodes and transactions and entity-connection-types as edges. This helps monitor and catch
criminals; information gathered from these studies is eventually fed to CSIS and the RCMP.
 Developed soft and hard address matching techniques using libpostal and clustering algorithms
 Created and designed networking graphing software to find connected entities and bad actors
Data Scientist (Research and Stats Officer); NS Education Dept., Halifax NS, 2017 – 2019
After designing and building an SQL Server database, focused on developing a complete data pipeline. This included modernising the
data use in SAE by implementing machine learning, especially natural language processing, on student and exam data.
 Developed GPU-based RNN with TensorFlow and spaCy to predict future assessment results
 Designed and developed Microsoft SQL Server database to house all data on Student Assessments
