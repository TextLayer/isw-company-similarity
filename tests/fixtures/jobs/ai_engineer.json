  "title": "Senior AI Engineer",
  "description": "The Senior AI Engineer plays a critical role in our team, working on both the frontend and backend architecture and orchestration layer for our AI systems. You'll build production-grade RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines, develop sophisticated AI Agent workflows, and create robust LLM integrations that power our customer-facing applications.",
  "expectations": "To succeed in this role, you'll need deep full-stack development expertise, hands-on experience with LLM and RAG implementations, and a strong understanding of modern AI Agent patterns. You should be passionate about prompt engineering and building scalable AI pipelines.",
  "responsibilities": [
    "Architect and maintain Python-based services using Flask and modern AI frameworks for RAG and Agent implementations",
    "Build and scale secure, well-structured API endpoints that interface with LLMs (OpenAI, Hugging Face models), vector databases, and agentic tools",
    "Implement advanced Agent orchestration logic, prompt engineering strategies, and tool chaining for complex AI workflows",
    "Design and optimize RAG pipelines, including data loaders, chunking strategies, vector embeddings, and search integration with Elasticsearch/OpenSearch",
    "Develop and maintain ML pipelines for processing, indexing, and retrieving data in vector stores",
    "Build seamless frontend experiences using Next.js, Vercel AI SDK, and modern React patterns for streaming LLM responses",
    "Containerize AI services using Docker and implement scalable deployment strategies with AWS ECS/Lambda",
    "Collaborate with AI research teams to productionize PyTorch models and Hugging Face transformers",
    "Optimize prompt engineering techniques for improved LLM performance and reliability using Langfuse observability",
